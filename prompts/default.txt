Use the provided photo exactly as-is for the person:
- Do NOT change the face, skin, body, clothes, lighting, or the area with the person.
- Keep all original details of the person intact and untouched.

Only modify the empty/background area:
- Add text only in the empty space of the background.
- Add Article title: "{{title}}"
- Add Hashtag/Tag: "#{{tag}}"
- Do not add any other objects or effects.

If compositing is needed, treat the photo as two layers:
1) Foreground layer (person) — unchanged, preserved fully.
2) Background layer — may be edited to place the text.
Keep the image ratio 1:1 and ensure the text is clear, readable, and high-contrast without covering the person.
